# Batch_jpg_to_png_converter
A very basic python program to convert all the .jpg(JPEG) images in a given directory to .png images


System requirements:
------python2+ installed. (Get the executable from if not already installed: https://www.python.org/downloads/)
------Pillow library installed (if not installed, open command prompt and enter the following after installing python from above:  pip install Pillow)

That's it. You're good to go now.
